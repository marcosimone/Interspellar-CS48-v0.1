# Interspellar

In order to make working easier, we should try to use the issue tracker.

 * Try to add whatever you are working on to the issues page and assign it to yourself, that way we all know what everyone else is working on.
 * If you notice a bug you aren't sure you can fix without some collaboration, add an issue with a description on what the bug is and how to reproduce it
 * If you think of good ideas to add to the game, add it to the issues page with the enhancement tag.
 
**Don't forget to tag any issues you add, and assign it to yourself if you are working on it**

* Also please add things to the wiki as you see fit.  It will help all of us in the long run.  This includes credits if you use someone else's work
